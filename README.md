# Make an Impact

This is a full stack javascript project using the MERN stack. It is still in its beginning stages with basic CRUD functions operational. 

The project's concept is a schedule app focusing on events that can help people make an impact in society. Events could be volunteer opportunities, ways to get involved proactively in politics, community gatherings etc.

Users would be able to add/edit their own events directly on their 'My Schedule' page, or add events from the 'Find Events' page to their 'My Schedule' page.

**3/28/18 - Current State of App:**
